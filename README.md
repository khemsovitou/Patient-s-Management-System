# Patient-s-Management-System
Hey guys ! this is my mini project in Algorithms 101 course in CamTech Univeristy 

This project is for Patient management system by using the C programming for integration and Ms.Excel or Google sheet as the database.
So, you test with this code by copying this file and play it on your IDE.
After that just enter number 1 & 2 on menu to make new data , and to export to excel you have to enter number 4 to convert the data to CSV file.
Then you have to open the Ms.Excel and import that CSV file, so you can see all the data. 

If you have any problem, don't hestitate to reach me out at CamTech University. 
Thank you ! <33
